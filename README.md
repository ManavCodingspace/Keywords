# Keywords#
1. **RISC** : A processor architecture that shifts the analytical process of a computational task from the execution or runtime to the preparation or compile time. By using less hardware or logic, the system can operate at higher speeds.

3. **CISC** : A complex instruction set computer (CISC /ˈsɪsk/) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.
4. ** KERNEL** : It is the primary interface between the hardware and the processes of a computer. The kernel connects these two in order to adjust resources as effectively as possible.The kernel is one of the initial programs loaded up on memory before the boot loader.The kernel has several important jobs, such as process and memory management, disk storage, and low-level networking.

  5. **DNS** : The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers. 
  6. ** Instruction set architecture** : Every computer has an ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), which is a set of registers, instructions, and other features visible to its low-level programmers.This ISA is commonly referred to as machine language, although the term is not entirely accurate.
