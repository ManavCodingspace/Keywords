# Keywords#
1. **RISC** : A processor architecture that shifts the analytical process of a computational task from the execution or runtime to the preparation or compile time. By using less hardware or logic, the system can operate at higher speeds.
3. **CISC** : A complex instruction set computer (CISC /ˈsɪsk/) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.
4. **KERNEL** : It is the primary interface between the hardware and the processes of a computer. The kernel connects these two in order to adjust resources as effectively as possible.The kernel is one of the initial programs loaded up on memory before the boot loader.The kernel has several important jobs, such as process and memory management, disk storage, and low-level networking.

  5. **DNS** : The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. DNS servers make it possible for people to input normal words into their browsers. 
 
  6. **Instruction set architecture** : Every computer has an ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), which is a set of registers, instructions, and other features visible to its low-level programmers.This ISA is commonly referred to as machine language, although the term is not entirely accurate.
  7. **Numpy** : It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
  8. **Pandas** : Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.Pandas is mainly used for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in DataFrames. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, Parquet, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.
  9. **BSD License** :Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) licenses are used for the distribution of many freeware, shareware and open source software.
  10. **Numa** : It is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessors in a multiprocessing system so they can share memory locally. The individual processors in a computing system share local memory and can work together. Data can flow smoothly and quickly since it goes through intermediate memory instead of a main bus.

 11. **LAN**: A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building
 12. **NANO** :A nanonetwork or nanoscale network is a set of interconnected nanomachines (devices a few hundred nanometers or a few micrometers at most in size), which are able to perform only very simple tasks such as computing, data storing, sensing and actuation.[1][2] Nanonetworks are expected to expand the capabilities of single nanomachines both in terms of complexity and range of operation by allowing them to coordinate, share and fuse information.
 13.  **PAN** :A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network for interconnecting electronic devices within an individual person's workspace.[1] A PAN provides data transmission among devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and personal digital assistants. PAN may be wireless or carried over wired interfaces such as USB.
 14.  **SAN**: A SAN (storage area network) is a tightly coupled, dedicated network of storage devices that provides a shared pool of storage and appears to each user on the network as if it were connected directly to the computer. A SAN connects via Fibre Channel and uses switches to manage storage data traffic. It is designed for quick, low-latency data access and easy scalability. San storage solutions are block storage-basedmeaning data is split into storage volumes that can be formatted with different protocols, such as iSCSI or Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP).

15. **NAS** :NAS (network-attached storage) refers to a file-level storage server connected to a computer network, providing data access to a group of users on that network. A NAS system connects via an Ethernet network and has redundant data structures for resiliency. It’s designed to be an affordable and easy-to-maintain network storage option.
16. **CAN**: A campus network, campus area network, corporate area network or CAN is a computer network made up of an interconnection of local area networks (LANs) within a limited geographical area.[1][2] The networking equipments (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, Cat5 cabling etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner: an enterprise, university, government etc.[3] A campus area network is larger than a local area network but smaller than a metropolitan area network (MAN) or wide area network (WAN).
17. **Router** :
